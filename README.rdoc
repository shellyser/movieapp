In order to run this on a Mac both Rails (I personally used Homebrew for this) and Bundler should be installed on your computer.
A couple of websites in case these are not installed:

* http://www.rackspace.com/blog/installing-rails-on-a-mac/
* http://bundler.io/

Once these are installed:

1. 'bundle install'
2. 'rails serve'

And you should be good to go! The app should run on http://localhost:3000/.
